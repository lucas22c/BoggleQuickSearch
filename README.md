Simple App with React frontend and Node.JS backend
App takes random 6 letter combinations and spits out possible words 4 letters or longer

Completed app was a great way to learn about using API Calls

Worked with express POSTing

also allowed me to experiment with Github copilot

great refresh on Node and first time diving deep into the React logic

To easily test the project download this repo and run 
  node index.ts in the backend
  npm start in the frontend

Enjoy beating all your friends in gamepigeon
